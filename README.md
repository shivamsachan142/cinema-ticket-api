## env

DATABASE_URL="postgresql://shivamsachan:*****@localhost:5432/cinema"

---

## APIs

1. POST /api/cinemas
Body: {
  "seatCount": 10
}

2. POST /api/cinemas/:id/seats/:seatNumber/purchase

3. POST /api/cinemas/:id/seats/consecutive/purchase

---

## Assumptions
1. Seat numbers are unique per cinema.
2. Seat availability is determined only by the isBooked flag.
3. Booking is immediate and irreversible (no cancel/reserve logic). #(not in the scope)
4. No user authentication/authorization included (kept out for simplicity).

---
## Concurrency & Scalability
1. To ensure safe booking under concurrent traffic and across multiple instances:
2. Booking logic uses SELECT ... FOR UPDATE in PostgreSQL via raw SQL queries.
3. Prismaâ€™s $transaction() ensures all operations are atomic and isolated.
4. This prevents race conditions and double-booking.
